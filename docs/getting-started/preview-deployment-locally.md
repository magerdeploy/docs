# Preview Deployment Locally

Right after initialized **Mager** for a project, you can start preview deployment locally by executing

```sh
mager dev
```

It will install http proxy and service that you have defined in `mager.yaml`. If this your first preview deployment locally you will need to trust certificate that generated by `mkcert` and add **Traefik** http proxy dashboard to your hosts.

```sh
sudo echo 'dashboard.traefik.wip 127.0.0.1' >> /etc/hosts
CAROOT=~/.mager/certs mkcert -install
```

Then finally you will need add another entry to your hosts file for your service host.

```sh
sudo echo 'your-service.com.wip 127.0.0.1' >> /etc/hosts
```
